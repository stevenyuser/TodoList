# TodoList

this is an example, so PAUL and MALCOLM can finally learn how to COMMENT and DOCUMENT your CODE,
so it is CLEAR to your READERS (PEOPLE READ YOUR CODE, INCLUDING YOURSELF) what your code DOES.

please just do it.

code is from Swiftful Thinking's excellent[ YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SwiftfulThinking) and [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEf1YS4vyW8&list=PLwvDm4VfkdpheGqemblOIA7v3oq0MS30i) :)
